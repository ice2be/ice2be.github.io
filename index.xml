One of the larger projects was hooking up a GPU accelerated SQL engine to Node.js. This enabled us to query extremely large datasets on NVIDIA GPUs straight from TypeScript and Node.js. For example, a downloaded copy of English Wikipedia is ~16 GBs. We were able to query this entire dataset from a Node process in only ~14 seconds with two NVIDIA Titan RTX GPUs.</description></item><item><title>Action Tag</title><link>https://mzegar.github.io/posts/20210920/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mzegar.github.io/posts/20210920/</guid><description>I recently went about developing a new modification/game-mode for s&amp;amp;box called &amp;ldquo;Action Tag&amp;rdquo;. You can think of it as a mix between Action Quake and Freeze Tag. This project was a solo-effort. It forced me to learn a few new tools such as Hammer, Blender, Model-doc, etc.
Hammer &amp;ldquo;2&amp;rdquo; s&amp;amp;box gives access to the latest set of Valve tools which includes access to Hammer. This version of Hammer is updated to support their latest engine &amp;ldquo;Source 2&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Hugo, Another Static Site Generator</title><link>https://mzegar.github.io/posts/20210515/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mzegar.github.io/posts/20210515/</guid><description>I always took pride in creating my personal websites basically from scratch. But, what&amp;rsquo;s the point of jumping through hoops when other developers already have for me. At this current time, static site generators are the new hip thing, so let&amp;rsquo;s try one out.
Hugo is a static site generator that basically wraps a bunch of markdown files. This got me excited as previously updating my website was a pain.
