I recently went about developing a new modification/game-mode for s&box called "Action Tag". You can think of it as
a mix between [Action Quake](https://youtu.be/oQW1zZBJnlU) and Freeze Tag. This project was a solo-effort. It forced me
to learn a few new tools such as Hammer, Blender, Model-doc, etc.

## Hammer "2"

[s&box](https://sbox.facepunch.com/news) gives access to the latest set of Valve tools which includes access to Hammer. This
version of Hammer is updated to support their latest engine "Source 2". It was extremely intuitive and easy to use. I needed to use
Hammer in order to build the map that my modification was going to play in. I managed to come up with this within ~1-2 days of work...

[If you want access to the uncompiled and compiled versions of this map, it's available here.](https://github.com/mzegar/at_reloaded_dev)

## Blender

I needed a modeled and animated viewmodel that resembled the player attempting to "tag" another player. I downloaded [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and got to
work animating. The s&box devs provided a `.fbx` file of the main character in their game. All I had to do is cut off the arm and animate it. You can check out the
animation in its full glory in the video linked below.

## Gameplay Snippet

There isn't enough players with access to s&box for me to make a trailer, so here's a quick snippet showcasing some gameplay.
