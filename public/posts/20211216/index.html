            <p>In late 2012, a friend from school introduced me to a game called Garry&rsquo;s mod. Garry&rsquo;s Mod is a sandbox game that has no set objective. Built on a modified version of Valves Source engine, Garry&rsquo;s Mod is an extremely modder-friendly game. As a result, many popular mods were created which led to the creation of multiplayer servers that revolved around specific mods.
<br>
<br>
Garry&rsquo;s mod was one of the first games I invested a good chunk of my free time in. As I played Garry&rsquo;s mod over the years, I began to become more entangled in the modding scene and that&rsquo;s when I began to take a liking to level design. After watching tutorials on YouTube, I began creating my first map in Valves level editing software known as Hammer. For many years, I have experimented with level design in the Source Engine and that leads me to today.</p>

<br>
Facepunch the game studio behind Garry's Mod is well into the development of a successor to Garry's Mod. Known as s&box, the premise of the game is identical. S&box as the name implies is a sandbox game just like Garry's Mod. On top of this, it is also utilizing Valve's more modern Source 2 engine. I was extremely lucky to have received a key from the queue system that was implemented for early access.
<br>
<br>
Before receiving access to s&box, I was utilizing the Source 2 development tools offered by Half-Life: Alyx. Learning these tools beforehand prepared me for s&box as the tools offered in s&box are virtually identical.
